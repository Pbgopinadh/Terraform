# Terraform

## AWS services used until now -> EC2, S3, Route53, VPC,2
Terraform notes.

doing changes manually is called Toil

Less toil more availabiltiy.

the extension of the file containing the infra as a code should be .tf
all the terraform files end with .tf

we can use multiple files in a folder terraform loads them in alphabetic order and complies them logically as per their dependency.

Terraform has 4 commands/phases:

1.) init - where the terraform files are read and required plugins, dependecies are taken care at this stage
2.) plan - this phase/command where we can see what is going to be created/modified/destoryed
3.) install - this is where the actual plan phase happen. creating infra
4.) destroy - in reality this is used rarely when customer is terminating their contact

in terraform everything is a block:

resouce "abc" "xyz"{
    block = {}
}

there is no concept of applying terraform on a single file. but we can create a directory and move requried .tf file there and execute tf commands.


<!-- below is the example of the all the arguments that can be passed for an ec2-instance

# resource "aws_instance" "example" {
#   ami                   = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"  # Replace with your AMI ID
#   instance_type         = "t2.micro"  # Replace with your instance type
#   availability_zone    = "us-west-2a"
#   subnet_id             = "subnet-0bb1c79de4EXAMPLE"  # Replace with your subnet ID
#   associate_public_ip_address = true
#   vpc_security_group_ids = ["sg-0a1b2c3d4e5f67890"]  # Replace with your security group ID
#   key_name              = "my-key-pair"  # Replace with your key pair name
#   user_data             = file("path/to/user_data_script.sh")
#   ebs_optimized         = true
#   monitoring            = true
#   tags = {
#     Name        = "MyEC2Instance"
#     Environment = "Development"
#   } -->

terrafor.tfvars is the default varaible values file that terraform is going to take if we dont explicitly mention it. 

sudo yum install -y yum-utils
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/RHEL/hashicorp.repo
sudo yum -y install terraform

order of precendence of variables: 

1. --var-file if only one

if multiple are given then  terraform plan -var="env=command_line" --var-file=dev.tfvars --var-file=qa.tfvars qa varibales will override dev variables if they are same.

2. -var"var=value" 

this will be considered if no --var-file is given.

3. *.auto.tfvars

4. terraform.tfvars default variable value file - if above none is given.

5. present in the script file.

exception handling using lookup

and map inside a map how to retreive the variable value.

Anime = {

    onepiece = {
        hero = "luffy",
        swordsman = "zoro",
        crewsize = 10
    }

    7sins = {
        hero = "meli"
        joker = "clown"
    }

}

functions in terraform -> functions cannot be created but can be consumed. we cannot create our own functions.

[1,2,3]

[2,3,1]

do you think the above are same in terraform -> no, even though the numbers are same terraform consider there are changes and it will destory and recreate in the modified order.

so always make sure to check these things.

when using lists order is very important.

for loop = for_each

try

Modules in terraform for DRY methodlogy. we can create them unlike functions.

modules in terraform are of 2 types:

1. Root Module - The path/folder from where we are calling actual module and also where we are running the terraform command.
2. child/calling/backened module - the actual module which is called from anothe module.

when we run terraform init

1. it is going to intialize the backend.
2. intiliase any modules.
2. intiliase plugin providers.

Module is simple way to call one terraform script from one another similar to roles in ansible.

how to get the output from clhild to root

syntax is module.(name of the module).(local name of the output)

it is always better to have different files for diferent components of terraform.

main.tf -> where the infra script is present
variables.tf -> where variables and there values are present
output.tf -> where the outputs are present. 

by following we can have organised structure.

the resource of the module should be a directory not a file.

how to read the already exisiting resources in AWS using terraform

using Data block we can filter and see all the properties of AWS existing resoures.

in modulev2 and moduletestv2 we have used the data concept to retreive the ami-id based on the name and sg based on the sg name

for AMIs the ami id may change but the name will not change.
for sg we have filtered it by the security group name.

depends_on: this depends_on is used to create dependecy between resources. lets say we have a requirement where. records are to be created after the instances are created. by default we cannot gurantee certain things.

so we use depends_on to tell terraform before creating this you create depends_on infra and then proceed with current one

depends_on is a list.

in any resource block mention depends_on = [resourcetype.resourcename,resourcetype1.resourcename1]

we dont use provisioners.

whenever we run a Terraform plan command. Terraform is going to create a state file which is a single source of truth. 

so whenever we run the terraform plan command the terraform is going to compare the current code and the statefile. there is also a backup of statefile as it is that importnat to the terraform.

whenever there are any differences we call it drift. a drift in infrastrucutre.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Terraform state file is a critical component of Terraform's infrastructure-as-code management. It maintains the mapping between the resources in your Terraform configuration and the real-world infrastructure that Terraform manages. Hereâ€™s an overview of its purpose and how it works:

Purpose of the Terraform State File
Tracking Resources: The state file keeps track of the resources that Terraform manages and their current state. This allows Terraform to understand what has been created, updated, or deleted in your infrastructure.

Performance: By storing resource data locally, the state file allows Terraform to efficiently determine the changes needed during operations like terraform plan and terraform apply without having to query the infrastructure provider repeatedly.

Dependency Management: It helps Terraform manage dependencies between resources. For example, if one resource depends on another, the state file tracks these relationships so Terraform can apply changes in the correct order.

Metadata Storage: The state file stores metadata about the resources, such as resource IDs and other attributes required for managing resources.

State File Structure
Location: By default, the state file is named terraform.tfstate and is stored in the root directory of your Terraform configuration. For remote state management, it can be stored in backends like AWS S3, Azure Storage, Google Cloud Storage, etc.

Format: The state file is typically in JSON format, which allows it to be easily read and written by Terraform.

Working with State Files
Viewing State: You can use commands like terraform show to view the contents of the state file and understand the current state of your infrastructure.

Modifying State: Occasionally, you may need to make manual changes to the state file. Terraform provides commands like terraform state rm, terraform state mv, and terraform state pull for managing and modifying the state.

Remote State: For teams or more complex setups, using a remote state backend is recommended. This ensures state consistency, locking, and sharing among team members.

State Locking: When using remote backends like AWS S3 with DynamoDB for locking, Terraform can prevent concurrent modifications by multiple users.

what are the cases, i need to do manual changes 

Modifying State: Occasionally, you may need to make manual changes to the state file. Terraform provides commands like terraform state rm, terraform state mv, and terraform state pull for managing and modifying the state.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

so when in a team, we have to make sure that everyone is using/refering to the same terraform state file. becuz if they are refering to their locally saved state file then obvs when we run terrafrom plan and apply even though the same infra is present. terraform will create same infra as it considers the locally saved statefile.

so in order to aviod duplication/complications it is a best practice for all the users to refer to a single statefile.

intializing backend is the first thing we see when running the terraform plan. backend is from which the state file is reffered or backed is where the terraform store its consistent data.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

check on provisioners concept.

we use the s3 bucket to store the statefile to refer as the backend.

We can direclty mention the backend detials as a block like below

terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "mybucket"
    key    = "path/to/my/key"
    region = "us-east-1"
  }
}

or we can use a option called  -backend-config=path where we can just give the below details in a path and give this path to the -backend-config parameter but we shouldn't forget to declare a empty backend terraform resource block in the configuration file. 

    bucket = "demodevops1"
    key    = "test/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-east-1"

terraform {
  backend "s3" {
  }
}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## An important note: tf.state file in s3 will only be created if the terraform apply is executed and the resources are created.

terraform providers and the backend will be same so it is better to mention these over the root level instead of folder level/path level hope you got the point.

Another thing is it is better to declare empty for the S3 backend and then provide the parameters as -backend-config so that we can have multi-environment creation control and code can be DRY.


## Terraform commands only consider .tf files in the current directory and dont consider from subdirectories unless they are mentioned in modules.

th backend configuration is for that specific directory and not to all the terraform files.
